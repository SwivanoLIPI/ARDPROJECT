One of my inventions in 2020 is a disinfector cloth mask. 
This mask is equipped with a contact killer that is able to destroy viruses and other micro-organisms. 
This innovation is very useful when dealing with covid19 outbreaks.
To ensure that this mask is truly harmless when used by humans, a series of qualification tests are made. 
This test uses several sensors including DFR Ph Meter v1.1 and DFR analog Turbidity which both function in measuring pH and turbidity. 
A DAQ system is made using several devices such as Arduino Uno, Battery 16430 Sheild and Groove Extended board and is connected to the two sensors. 
The results obtained can be seen in the text and image data included in the file in this repository
