Other Contributors

- Dr. Deni Shidqi Khaerudini, S.Si, M.Eng
- Gerald Ensang Timuda, S.Si, M.Eng

This software are passed Quality and Validation test that reviewed by those researchers. The softwre are able to :

1. Retrieved data of measurements in real time using the sensors
2. Saved the data of measurements
3. Open to modified with other sensors


**Note** :  _This software is produced and managed using visual basic programe_ and `Arduino IDE` as assembly program to control DAQ serial measurements
